<h2>OVERKILL</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>
You only hear what you want to hear,<br />
So you don’t understand that I’m <br />
Half the way out of the door,<br />
You’re in your own world of fantasy,<br />
But I can’t live on dreams or on<br />
Lies that you tell anymore.<br />
<br />
Is this the future you’ve planned for me?<br />
Is it time to decide if I’m in or I’m out of your game,<br />
Well I was hoping for so much more,<br />
And the energy is leaving me.<br />
<br />
I tried to fight for what I thought was right<br />
But I let it go,<br />
I let it go,<br />
Turn out the lights and kiss me goodnight ‘cos<br />
I’m letting go, <br />
I let it go.<br />
<br />
Your ultimatums are overkill,<br />
Can you be so demanding?<br />
There’s no understanding besides,<br />
You make up rules as you go along,<br />
And it’s no surprise when it’s you who decides,<br />
<br />
Don’t give me anything I can’t keep,<br />
If it’s all for yourself then there’s<br />
No need for help anymore,<br />
I’m taking back what I gave to you,<br />
‘Cos the fairy tale has gone to hell.<br />
<br />
I tried to fight for what I thought was right<br />
But I let it go,<br />
I let it go,<br />
Turn out the lights and kiss me goodnight ‘cos<br />
I’m letting go, <br />
I let it go.<br />
<br />
The worst of you<br />
Brings out the worst in me,<br />
Is it any wonder we can’t be<br />
The people who we ought to be,<br />
Is there any other destiny?<br />
<br />

<h2>KEEP CALM </h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>
You had a house on the prettiest side of town,<br />
Well it was pretty ‘til they came along and pulled it down.<br />
You had a wife, she was sweeter than candyfloss,<br />
Until you found her eating candy in bed with your boss.<br />
<br />
You and I are not the kind of people who can fake,<br />
Comes a time when even we can feel as if we’ve<br />
Taken more than we can take,<br />
<br />
So keep calm,<br />
And carry on,<br />
Don’t stop and think about what you have done.<br />
Keep calm,<br />
And carry on,<br/>
Remember that your life has only just begun,<br/>
All that phony paranoia is holding you down,<br/>
No-one controls you or pushes you around,<br/>
Keep calm and carry on,<br/>
It’s the same deal for everyone.<br/>

You had a job that was beyond your widest dreams,<br/>
Until the company came apart at the seams,<br/>
You took your holidays far away in the sun,<br/>
But now you’re checking into places where there’s room for one.<br/>

You and I are not the kind of people they can beat,<br/>
No no,<br/>
Comes a time when people get together
And revenge can taste so sweet,<br/>

So keep calm,<br/>
And carry on,<br/>
Don’t stop and think about what you have done.<br/>
Keep calm,<br/>
And carry on,<br/>
Remember that your life has only just begun,<br/>
All that phony paranoia is holding you down,<br/>
No-one controls you or pushes you around,<br/>
Keep calm and carry on,<br/>
It’s the same deal for everyone.<br/>

<h2>CHILD IN ARMS</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>
Night-time falls on a distant land,<br/>
An eleven year-old soldier sleeps with a gun in his hand,<br/>
His eyes are closed but his mind’s awake,<br/>
Is he dreaming of tomorrow and the lives he’ll take?<br/>
<br />
Do do do do…<br />
<br />
An orphaned child who’s been taught to kill<br />
By and older kid who’s stamped on his future and snapped his will,<br/>
No space left for his innocence,<br/>
‘Cos to live a different what would simply make no sense<br />
<br />
Do do do do…<br />
<br />
Childhood is too precious to be wasted on a war<br />
That nobody can win and no-one<br />
Knows just what it’s for.<br/>
<br />
Bullets fly and a shell explodes,<br/>
They’ll be picking up the pieces for years along these roads.<br/>
I don’t know what the answer is,<br/>
But I’m positive we can’t keep going on like this.<br/>
Give each and every child you know a better life,<br/>
Give them better things to play with than a gun or a knife.<br/>
Educate them and watch them grow,<br/>
Give them water, give them food<br />
And give them seeds to sow.<br/>
 <br />
Do do do do…<br />
<br />
What can we do to save<br />
A child in arms?<br/>
<br />
</p>

<h2>YOU’RE THE ONE</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>
We were living in a different world,<br/>
A southern boy and a northern girl,<br/>
Looking out for something but we<br />
Never knew what.<br/>
Taking sides had never made much sense,<br/>
We broke the barriers and jumped the fence,<br/>
We were happy with the life we had,<br/>
We took what we got.<br/>
<br />
Comes a time you’ve got to break that chain,<br/>
Something better something less mundane,<br/>
Doesn’t matter where you go it’s just the journey you need.<br/>
Instead of acting like an automat,<br/>
Running ‘round until your battery’s flat,<br/>
Someone comes along and makes you <br />
Feel you’ve been freed.<br/>
<br />
You’re the one taking me higher,<br/>
You’re the one taking me so much higher,<br/>
You’re the one taking me higher,<br/>
And I’m stronger than I was before,<br/>
Lift me up and bring me back for more.<br/>
<br />
You get your motivation where you can,<br/>
Find a way to be a better man,<br/>
You need a partner with the strength<br />
To let you do as you choose.<br/>
Well you’d better believe in yourself<br />
So she’ll believe in you,<br/>
You get together in the end and find she’s pulling you through.<br/>
<br />
You’re the one taking me higher,<br/>
You’re the one taking me so much higher,<br/>
You’re the one taking me higher,<br/>
And I’m stronger than I was before,<br/>
Lift me up and bring me back for more.<br/>
<br />
Well you’d better believe in yourself<br />
If you want it to get any better,<br/>
She can take you to the top of the World,<br/>
She can lift you right up if you let her…<br />

<a name="goodbye"></a>
<h2>GOODBYE</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>

Thinking about you and what you left behind,<br/>
It’s been almost a year to the day,<br/>
And though I can’t pretend it was unexpected<br />
There were things I didn’t have time to say.<br/>
<br />
Thinking about you,<br/>
Do you sense the attention,<br/>
Do you feel anything at all?<br/>
Did the last chance we had to communicate<br />
Terminate with that final call?<br/>
<br />
Call it pain,<br/> call it pride,<br/>
But it tears me up inside,<br/>
‘Cos I always believed we’d have more time you and I.<br/>
I can’t grieve,<br/> I can’t cry,<br/>
Something stops me,<br/>
God knows why,<br/>
But I never thought I’d be here to say goodbye,<br/>
To say goodbye.<br/>
<br />
Thinking about us,<br/>
Trying to piece together<br />
Some memories of me as a child.<br/>
Did you hold my hand<br />
As we walked together<br />
As the storms blew us black and wild.<br/>
Are you thinking about me<br />
But you can’t remember<br />
If you ever held me oh so tight?<br/>
Did you answer my calls<br />
As I cried in my sleep<br />
When the nightmares came to me each night?<br/>
<br />
Thinking about you,<br/> in a secret garden,<br/>
Surrounded by the ones you love:<br />
Your daddy stands with his hands on your shoulders,<br/>
High in the skies above,<br/>
High in the skies above.<br/>
 <br />
Call it pain,<br/> call it pride,<br/>
But it tears me up inside,<br/>
‘Cos I always believed we’d have more time you and I.<br/>
I can’t grieve,<br/> I can’t cry,<br/>
Something stops me,<br/>
God knows why,<br/>
But I never thought I’d be here to say goodbye,<br/>
To say goodbye.<br/>
<br />
What do we have,<br/>
Do we go through the motions?<br/>
What’s left to say<br />
When the time has run out?<br/>
Wind back the clock,<br/>
But the hands are all broken,<br/>
Father and son are history<br />
And that’s the way it has to be.<br/>
<br />
Thinking about you.<br/> Goodbye.<br/>

<h2>AFTER LIFE</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>

There’s a kind of love that lasts<br />
When the breath of life has passed,<br/>
We are humbled by it’s grace<br />
And we tremble at it’s trace,<br/>
Call it belief<br />
You can call it anything you like,<br/>
A family’s grief,<br/>
Sonny’s fallen from his motorbike.<br/>
<br />
There are many ways to live,<br/>
How you take and how you give,<br/>
Do we get a second chance,<br/>
Or is this our only dance.<br/>
Say what you think,<br/>
Some religions preach eternity.<br/>
After this life<br />
You can come back who you want to be.<br/>
<br />
Whatever chord we’re strumming<br />
It’s the same old engine that’s humming,<br/>
Well they’re standing still and we’re running,<br/>
We’re all the same,<br/> we’re all the same.<br/>
<br />
You could come back as a bird,<br/>
But would your song be truly heard?<br/>
Or return as king or queen<br />
Or as something in-between.<br/>
Somebody kind,<br/>
Someone cruel or a lilac tree,<br/>
Create a cure for the blind,<br/>
Be a flower or a fish in the sea.<br/>
<br />
Whatever bets you’re placing,<br/>
It’s the same dilemma you’re facing,<br/>
Do we slow right down or go racing?<br/>
We’re all the same,<br/> we’re all the same.<br/>
<br />
What will you be?<br/>
<br />

<h2>POURQUOI PAS ?<br/></h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>
<br />
Well if you want to be the king of the world,<br/> 
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
If you’re a girl and you like sleeping with girls<br />
Pourquoi pas,<br/> 
Vu comme ça<br />
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
<br />
It doesn’t matter what you do<br />
Or how you do it,<br/>
All that counts is the feeling you get<br />
When you go through it.<br/>
<br />
Well if you want to dress in rubber and chains<br />
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Vu comme ça <br />
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
And if your losses come to more than your gains<br />
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
<br />
Stop wasting your time thinking<br />
« How can I get it?<br/> »
Twenty years on from now,<br/>
You’ll look back and you won’t regret it.<br/>
<br />
Well if you’re happy living just for your job,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Be a dandy,<br/> be a slut,<br/> be a slob,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
<br />
Don’t sigh and complain about the things that you won’t be,<br/>
You’ve gotta<br />
Stand up for yourself,<br/>
Take a deep breath and just say « tant pis ».<br/>
<br />
Well if you want to spend your life on the bench<br />
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Dit comme ça<br />
Pourquoi pas<br />
Well you could even try and sing it in French<br />
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Un peu comme moi,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>

 <br/>
Tu es branché latex et chaînes<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Vu comme ça<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Et si au final, tu perds plus que tu ne gagnes <br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
 <br/>
Ne perds plus de temps à chercher<br/>
comment obtenir ce que tu veux<br/>
et dans 20 ans, tu verras,<br/>
tu ne le regretteras pas.<br/>
 <br/>
Tu ne vis que pour ton travail,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Sois un dandy,<br/> une pouffe,<br/> un flemmard,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
 <br/>
Arrête de t’apitoyer, de rêver à tout ce que tu ne seras pas<br/>
C’est à toi de t’affirmer,<br/>
Respire un bon coup et dis-toi « tant pis ».<br/>
 <br/>
Et si tu veux rester sur la touche<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Dit comme ça<br/>
Pourquoi pas<br/>
Tu pourrais même le chanter en français,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/> Un peu comme moi,<br/> Pourquoi pas ?<br/>

<br />
Na,<br/> du möchtest gern König der Welt sein,<br/>
Warum denn nicht ?<br/>
Du bist eine Frau und gehst gern mit anderen Mädchen ins Bett<br/>
Warum denn nicht ?<br/>
So gesehen<br/>
Warum denn nicht ?<br/>

Egal, was du tust<br/>
Oder wie du es tust<br/>
Wichtig ist nur das Gefühl,das du hast,<br/>
wenn du's tust.<br/>
<br/>
Na, du ziehst gern Gummisachen mit Ketten an<br/>
Warum denn nicht ?<br/>
So gesehen<br/>
Warum denn nicht ?<br/>
Auch wenn du am Ende mehr verlierst als gewinnst<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
<br/>
Hör doch auf,<br/> deine Zeit zu vertrödeln und zu denken,<br/> « Wie kann ich's schaffen ? »<br/>
In 20 Jahren schaust du zurück und bereust nichts.<br/>
<br/>
Na, wenn du nur für deinen Job lebst<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Sei doch ein Dandy, eine Schlampe, ein Gammler,<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Jammere nicht darüber, was du verpasst hast und was du nie sein wirst<br/>
Du mußt,<br/>

<br/>
Na, du willst lebenslang im Abseits stehen<br/>
Warum denn nicht ?<br/>

Na, du könntest ebenso versuchen, auf Französisch zu singen<br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>
Etwa wie ich es tue <br/>
Pourquoi pas ?<br/>

<h2>THE WILBRAHAMS </h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>

Where did you go to?<br/>
Was it a distant and exotic place?<br/>
 A new existence and another face,<br/>
Somewhere on the farthest side of the World?<br/>
Where did you run to?<br/>
Was it a planet on a different scale?<br/>
Were you the Jonah or were you the whale?<br/>
Are the oceans wide enough for one girl?<br/>
I got your postcard<br />
And I’m looking so hard,<br/>
<br />
But where the hell are the Wilbrahams?<br/>
Is this Bermuda or Pakistan?<br/>
The map you gave me was just a sham,<br/>
‘Cos I have no idea where I am.<br/>
Where the hell are the Wilbrahams,<br/>
And why and where did we take that turn?<br/>
We’re set on getting our fingers burned,<br/>
I guess some people will never learn.<br/>
<br />
Where did you fly to <br />
And did you get the feeling that I’d clipped your wings?<br/>
How could you blame me for so many things?<br/>
Was it so damn hard to be there by my side?<br/>
So how do I find you?<br/>
I’m in the middle of an open field,<br/>
Somehow your whereabouts are well concealed,<br/>
Something tells me this is the end of the ride.<br/>
The sooner the better,<br/>
Until I got your letter,<br/>
<br />
So where the hell are the Wilbrahams?<br/>
Is this Bermuda or Pakistan?<br/>
The map you gave me was just a sham,<br/>
‘Cos I have no idea where I am.<br/>
Where the hell are the Wilbrahams,<br/>
And why and where did we take that turn?<br/>
We’re set on getting our fingers burned,<br/>
I guess some people will never learn.<br/>
<br />
I got your letter,<br/>
The sooner the better,<br/>
I’ve got to find you,<br/>
I’m back to remind you…

Well we’re starting a box for the year 3000<br />
What’re you going to put in it?<br/>
So the mums and the dads and the kids of the future<br />
Can see the way we lived a bit<br />
Well the day they open that vault<br />
Will they say everything was our fault?<br/>
Before the fall<br />
We blew it all.<br/>
<br />
Well they’re starting a box for the year 3000<br />
What’re you going to sacrifice?<br/>
Is there just one thing you can live without,<br/>
Is there anything without a price?<br/>
Well the morning they pick that lock
We will all appear in the dock,<br/>
When they judge us<br />
They’ll begrudge us.<br/>
<br />
Well they’re starting a box for the year 3000<br />
What’re you going to put in it?<br/>
So the mums and the dads and the dogs and the cats<br />
Can see the way we lived a bit,<br/>
Well the folks gathered ‘round that hole<br />
Will discover all the things that we stole,<br/>
Run away now,<br/>
Nothing to say now.<br/>
<br />
What’s the sum of what we did?<br/>
Fill the box and close the lid.<br/>

I’m not the man that you dreamed of,<br/>

Call me a freak,<br/>

All we have done<br />
Divided by one<br />
We’ve come to a beautiful end.<br/>
Fade to black,<br/>
Don’t look back.<br/>
<br />
Where is the life that we longed for,<br/>
How did it all come to this?<br/>
Wave me goodbye if you want to,<br/>
Separate us with a kiss.<br/>
<br />
So far down the road,<br/>
Sharing the load,<br/>
Wounds that time couldn’t mend.<br/>
All that we had<br />
Wasn’t so bad,<br/>
We’ve come to a beautiful end.<br/>

<h2>WELCOME TO THE WORLD</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>Well if everyone was half as good as you<br />

  There&rsquo;d be so many things that we could do,<br />
  Positivity would be the rule,<br />
  Maybe even loving would be cool.<br />
  I finally found a chance to start again,<br />
  Someone I could fight for and defend,<br />
I know it&rsquo;s gonna work out in the end.</p>

<p>Welcome to the World,<br />
  Welcome to the World my son,<br />
  You&rsquo;re gonna meet a little girl,<br />
  You&rsquo;re gonna have yourself a whole lot of fun,<br />
  Welcome to the World,<br />
  Act like it&rsquo;s the only one,<br />

  Every oyster needs a pearl,<br />
  And you&rsquo;re only just a lifetime away from the Sun.</p>
<p>Well I had enough of living with the pain,<br />
  And I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go through that again,<br />
  You can fix a broken day with just a smile,<br />
  It&rsquo;s enough to help me run that extra mile.<br />

  I think of all the years I left behind,<br />
  I&rsquo;ll make a future fit for you to find,<br />
  You&rsquo;ll never have a deeper love than mine.</p>
<p>Welcome to the World&hellip;</p>
<p>Watching you start a new day,<br />
  Changing before my eyes,<br />

  Seems like you&rsquo;re bringing my way<br />
  Love without compromise.</p>
<p>Welcome to the World&hellip;</p><br />

<h2>YOU WON'T GET ME DOWN</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner) </h3>

<p>Break us apart, say what you have to say,<br />
  Shatter my heart,<br />
  Throw all that&rsquo;s left away,<br />
  You&rsquo;re dragging me down,<br />
  You&rsquo;re dragging me down,<br />

  But I&rsquo;m way ahead of you,<br />
  Covering ground,<br />
I do what i have to do.</p>
<p>Well couldn&rsquo;t try to hide it,<br />
  Running across your tracks,<br />
  The truth is I&rsquo;m tired of filling the cracks,<br />

  So come around and waste my time,<br />
  Draw me &lsquo;cross the line...</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t get me down,<br />
  You can kick, you can bite,<br />
  You can tear me up and take all that&rsquo;s mine,<br />

  But I&rsquo;ll still be around,<br />
  Ring the bell, dim the lights,<br />
  Tell the rest of them I&rsquo;m calling time,<br />
  Get out of my mind.</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s news, see if the picture fits,<br />

  Battered and bruised, trying to pick up the bits,<br />
  No camouflage can hide what you are inside,<br />
  It&rsquo;s all a mirage, I watch you as you slide.</p>
<p>Well I never meant to change you,<br />
  I never dared to try,<br />
  The truth has turned into one more lie,<br />

  So call me up and do it fast,<br />
  Make this call the last.</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t get me down...</p>

<h2>TELEPHONE CALL (To A Friend)</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner)</h3> 
</div><br /><br />
<p>Hey friend, why such a sullen face?<br />
  You&rsquo;re pacing up and down like your life&rsquo;s a disgrace,<br />
  There must be something I can do<br />
  To make it all a little bit better for you,<br />

  It seems like you&rsquo;ve wasted your life,<br />
  I know you&rsquo;ve had your fair share of trouble &amp; strife,<br />
There has to be a better way I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>Hey friend, why d&rsquo;you try to put me down?<br />
  And are you feeling better now that I&rsquo;m not around?<br />

  Was it something that I said,<br />
  That got so much attention going &lsquo;round in your head?<br />
  And was it worth the fights and the tears,<br />
  Maybe things can change after all of these years<br />
  There has to be a better way I&rsquo;d say.</p>

<p>Give yourself a little time to think about the future,<br />
  Help yourself to unwind,<br />
  And get the past right out of your mind</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;ll come around when it all falls through?<br />
  You&rsquo;ll never keep a friend acting like you do,<br />
  Who&rsquo;ll hold your hand in the final hour?<br />

  You think that you&rsquo;re the cream but the cream&rsquo;s gone sour.</p>
<p>Hey friend, why&rsquo;d you make up all those lies?<br />
  Nobody was fooled, guess it wasn&rsquo;t so wise,<br />
  Did it make you feel supreme?<br />
  And have you woken up after dreaming your dream?<br />

  How&rsquo;re you gonna make amends,<br />
  Now you&rsquo;re getting fucked by your foes &amp; your friends?<br />
  There has to be a better way I&rsquo;d say.<br />

<p>Give yourself a little time...</p>

  You wanna sleep with the lights on,<br />
  So you don&rsquo;t miss a minute,<br />
  And a New York Thousand is a million parts pure gold,<br />
  Can a city be so beautiful?<br />
  So beautiful...</p>

<p>Cooler than cool,<br />
  Bending every rule,<br />
  So complex yet so clear,<br />
  You disappear when you step into here.<br />

  Come on, come on let&rsquo;s go.<br />
  You want it, you got it...</p>
<p>All over a sudden the nightmare was over,<br />
  Sunlight poured in through the cracks in the door.<br />
  I pulled back the blanket and saw you beside me.<br />
  I stroked your cheek just to be sure.</p>

<p>After the rain, after the winter,<br />
  In spite of the storms you are still here,<br />
  Right to the end, whatever the future,<br />
  Our destination lovers and friends.</p>
<p>Nobody knows when the party is over,<br />
  Who gives a damn if the guests have all gone.<br />
  I&rsquo;ve all I need lying beside me,<br />

  We&rsquo;re two helpless souls entwined into one.</p>
<p>After the rain, after the winter,<br />
  In spite of the storms you are still here,<br />
  Right to the end, whatever the future,<br />
  Our destination lovers and friends.</p>
<p>Straight from my head,<br />

  Out of the window,<br />
  Over the hedge, <br />
  Over the fields,<br />
  Along the hillside,<br />
  Up on the the mountain,<br />
  Over the moon, up to the sun, we will be one.</p>

<h2>A TWO-MINUTE SONG</h2>
<h3>(words & music Mark Brenner)</h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>She was a lover unlike any other<br />
She gave herself freely away,<br />

She wasn&rsquo;t cheap and her passion ran  deep,<br />
Which at times might have got in our  way.<br />
Our love was as brief as a sigh of  relief<br />
But her memory is fixed in my brain,<br />
The pictures will always remain.<br />
<br />
Invited, delighted, but over-excited,<br />
But what else would any man do?<br />
The very name Lisa means you&rsquo;ve got  to please her<br />

In everyway, all the night through.<br />
Rustling the chintz we were screwing to  Prince,<br />
Forgetting about everything,<br />
Especially my wedding ring.<br />
<br />
Too many ties mean that love often dies<br />
Before it can truly awake.<br />
With a heart full of lead well you fall  from the bed,<br />
But it&rsquo;s better to love and to lose,<br />

And in any event, who can choose?<br />
And maybe it didn&rsquo;t last long,<br />
But it&rsquo;s enough for a two-minute  song.<br />

<p>Tick tock, there's a bomb just waiting to go off,<br />

  A cocktail of Prozac and of Molotov, <br />
  She'll make him pay for yesterday, <br />
  He made her life a mess   in one too many ways. <br />

  <br />
  She could be what they want her to be, <br />
  If   they'd stop<br />
  The voices in her head... <br />
  <br />
  Too many hours have passed her   by, <br />
  She's made her mind up and tonight he'll die. <br />

  Could use the poison,   could use the knife, <br />
  She'll make a widow out of someone else's wife. <br />
  <br />
  She could be what they want her to be, <br />
  If they'd stop<br />
  The voices   in her head... <br />

  And so the page is slowly turned, <br />
  Between the rages and   the places she got burned, <br />
  Relieve the pressure, relive the pain, <br />
  She's   sinking deeper and she can't get out again. <br />
  <br />
  She could be what they want   her to be, <br />

  If they'd stop<br />
  The voices in her head... <br />

  Sick of the life I've   tasted, <br />
  Run out of town. <br />
  Been here before, it's nothing new to me, <br />
  There's nothing more this world can do to me, <br />
  <br />

  Open the bottle, <br />
  See what's inside. <br />
  Drained to the bottom, <br />
  Emptied of pride. <br />
  Looking around, I see what's become of me. <br />
  I thank the Lord there's only   one of me. <br />

  <br />
  Well I feel so cold from my head to my toes, <br />
  Ask myself   how I've come so close<br />
  To zero. <br />
  So close. <br />
  <br />
  I pray to the heavens, <br />

  They watch and laugh. <br />
  They see me sliding<br />
  Right off the graph. <br />
  Pieces of me lie in disarray, <br />
  No lord above has anything more to say, <br />
  <br />

  Well I feel so cold from my head to my toes, <br />
  Ask myself how I've   come so close<br />
  To zero. <br />
  Will I just disappear after all these years, <br />
  Drift down a river on a flood of tears, <br />
  To zero. <br />

  <br />
  Well I'm   already dead and I don 't know why, <br />
  And there's room down here for a losing   guy. <br />
  <br />
  One more forgotten, <br />
  Ignorant soul, <br />
  Twisting and   turning<br />

  Straight down the hole. <br />
  Been here before, it's nothing new to me, <br />
  There's nothing more this world can do to me, <br />
  <br />
  Well I feel so cold   from my head to my toes, <br />
  Ask myself how I've come so close<br />

  To zero. <br />
  Will I just disappear after all these years, <br />
  Drift down a river on a   flood of tears, <br />
  To zero. <br />
  So close... <br />

<h2>FOR ME FOR YOU</h2>
<h3>(words &amp; music : Mark Brenner)</h3>
</div><br /><br />
<p>You put me down <br />

  But I fell on my feet oh yeah, <br />
  Walked into the kitchen   and <br />
  Out went the heat, oh yeah. <br />
  You threw me out but<br />
  I left you with   no regret, <br />
  Well I got the picture<br />

  As clear as a man can get, <br />
  I wanna   shout it out<br />
  From the top of a tree, <br />
  It's over now between you and me. <br />
  <br />
  Call it all a big mistake, <br />

  Or a chance I have to take, <br />
  Only one   thing left that's true, <br />
  You're not for me, I'm not for you. <br />
  <br />
  Feels   like I'm breathing again for the <br />
  First time in years, <br />

  Wiped the slate   clean<br />
  With laughter in the place of tears. <br />
  You played your joker and<br />
  I   threw it back in your face, <br />
  Let's see how easily<br />
  I am to be replaced. <br />

  I wanna shout it out from the<br />
  Top of a hill, <br />
  If it don't work now   then<br />
  It never will. <br />
  <br />
  Call it all a big mistake, <br />

  Or a chance I have   to take, <br />
  Only one thing left that's true, <br />
  You're not for me, I'm not for   you. <br />
  Call it all a big mistake, <br />
  Or a chance I have to take, <br />

<p>The kids that played in my street,<br />
  The places we used to   meet, <br />
  The broken gates of my school, <br />
  The sentimental and cruel. <br />

  White fingers numbed by the cold, <br />
  And boys that do as they're told, <br />
  The girls that I tried to kiss, <br />
  The places we used to piss. <br />

  All   the things that made us real, <br />

  Programmed us with how to feel, <br />
  Made us   seem invincible, <br />
  When I thought I had it all, <br />
  <br />
  They've gone... away X   2<br />
  <br />
  A tender clip round the ear, <br />

  And days with nothing to fear<br />
  You   putting me in my place, <br />
  My hair as long as my face <br />
  <br />
  All kinds of shit   we were taught, <br />
  And all the records we bought, <br />

  Not showing we were   afraid, <br />
  Trying so hard to get laid. <br />
  All the things that made us grow, <br />
  Taught us what we had to know, <br />
  Made us feel the best and worst, <br />
  Masters of the universe, <br />

  <br />
  They've gone... away X 2<br />

<h2>JUMPING THE GUN</h2>
<h3>(words &amp; music : Mark Brenner)</h3>
</div><br /><br />

<p>It's as hot as hell, in fucking nowhere.<br />
  When it comes to   mistakes, well I've seen my share. <br />
  You dragged me out to this godforsaken   place, <br />
  And wiped away trust like the dust from my face. <br />
  <br />
  I said I'd   go where you wanted to go. <br />
  My love was blind, how was I to know. <br />

  Bogey   and Kate on the African Queen<br />
  But I got rubbed in the dirt, somewhere in   between. <br />
  <br />
  Sinking like lead, <br />
  Yeah you wrecked my head, and it's   dragging me down. <br />
  Scream and shout<br />

  'Cos I found you out and I won't hang   a round. <br />
  Sink or swim, <br />
  But you threw me in, and it's only begun. <br />
  I   think you should know<br />
  If you're letting me go, well I'm jumping the gun. <br />
  <br />

  There's the finest of lines between Heaven and Hell, <br />
  And living with   you, I walked it so well. <br />
  Dirt to the East, scrub to the West, <br />
  You wiped   away love and you sullied the rest. <br />
  <br />
  Sinking like lead, <br />

  Yeah you   wrecked my head, and it's dragging me down. <br />
  Scream and shout<br />
  'Cos I found   you out and I won't hang a round. <br />
  Sink or swim, <br />
  But you threw me in, and   it's only begun. <br />
  I think you should know<br />

<h2>MY HOME TOWN</h2>
<h3>(words &amp; music Mark Brenner)</h3></div><br /><br />
<p>They say the factory is closing, <br />
  900 people for the   dole, <br />

  The public gardens are empty, <br />
  'Cos it's getting cold. <br />
  Say did   you hear that the bypass<br />
  Is going underground, <br />
  And that your good friend,   the loser, <br />
  Is nowhere to be found. <br />

  <br />
  There is more to life than my   home town<br />
  There is more to life than my home town. <br />
  <br />
  There was a bus   lane disaster, <br />
  Twenty people in a state, <br />
  It was the fault of the driver, <br />

  They died because the bus was late, <br />
  And in the papers they're   saying<br />
  I've disappeared without trace, <br />
  Didn't they notice, I left the   pictures, <br />
  The grey hairs and the lines on my face. <br />
  <br />

  There is more to   life than my home town<br />
  There is more to life than my home town. <br />
  <br />
  That's why they make planes, <br />
  That 's why they build ships, <br />
  That's why they put the world at our fingertips. <br />

  <br />
  I know that   housework is housework<br />
  Anywhere in the world, <br />
  But it takes fresh winds to   help you<br />
  Get your flag unfurled, <br />
  I miss my children, but I can't   stay<br />

  In a place where I can't breathe, <br />
  I tried for so long, I tried to   fight it, <br />
  But I knew I had to leave. <br />
  <br />
  There is more to life than my   home town<br />
  There is more to life than my home town. <br />

  <br />
  That's why they   make planes, <br />
  That 's why they build ships, <br />
  That's why they put the world   at our fingertips. <br />

  You're helpless too, <br />
  My only life, <br />
  My only purpose<br />
  Is to be   with you. <br />

<h2>ROMANIA</h2>
<h3>(words &amp; music Mark Brenner)</h3></div><br /><br />
<p>Picture a journey down a long, long road, <br />
  Way too scared   to look behind us, <br />

  Me and my sister, in just the clothes we wore, <br />
  Hoping   that nobody would come out to find us. <br />
  <br />
  We were the outcasts, ten and   twelve years old, <br />
  Moving ahead, sticking together, <br />
  Leaving behind a   world that had kicked us out, <br />

  And told us to follow through, and stay out   forever. <br />
  <br />
  We came a long, long way<br />
  To find the light of day, <br />
  'Cos   they told us that we couldn't stay<br />
  In Romania. <br />

  <br />
  High in the mountains   we were almost safe, <br />
  Deep in the valleys we were a target, <br />
  Had to move   faster, had to stay alive, <br />
  And spend our days in a haze, <br />
  Trying to   forget. <br />

  <br />
  We came a long, long way<br />
  To find the light of day, <br />
  'Cos   they told us that we couldn't stay<br />
  In Romania. <br />
  <br />
  I can remember when   Mama and me<br />

  Took a walk by the river one day, <br />
  And she told me that I had   to run find my sister, <br />
  And take her a long way away. <br />
  Mama stayed, <br />
  And was betrayed. <br />
  <br />

  We came a long, long way<br />
  To find the light of   day, <br />
  'Cos they told us that we couldn't stay<br />
  In Romania. <br />

<h2>THE MAN WHO RAN FROM EVERYTHING</h2>
<h3>(words &amp; music Mark Brenner)</h3></div><br /><br />
<p>He had a wife, <br />
  Who ran his life, <br />

  He had a car, a yard,   a cul de sac, <br />
  He had the perks, <br />
  He had the works, <br />
  He had a suit, the   fruit of an aching back, <br />
  He liked to spend<br />
  The odd weekend<br />

  At the   coast, with toast, at B &amp; Bs, <br />
  Curried delights<br />
  On Friday nights, <br />
  With a middle-aged strip-a-gram on his knees, <br />
  <br />
  He made a plan to   disappear, <br />

  To leave the Bensons and the beer, <br />
  To find a place they'd   never find, <br />
  To leave reality behind, <br />
  <br />
  The man who ran from   everything, <br />
  The working week, the telephone ring, <br />

  The man who ran from   everything, <br />
  To find a place where birds could sing<br />
  <br />
  He liked to smoke, <br />
  And tell a joke, <br />
  And get his wife to do the laundry<br />

  He liked a drink, <br />
  It helped him think<br />
  About the kids, the car, the VAT, <br />
  Too many names, <br />
  Too many games, <br />
  And how he'd never win the lottery, <br />

  Too many plays, <br />
  And holidays, <br />
  And now his wife was into pottery, <br />
  <br />
  He made a plan   to get away, <br />
  He set the date, he named the day, <br />

  He left them all asleep   in bed, <br />
  They're better off alone he said, <br />
  <br />
  The man who ran from   everything, <br />
  The working week, the telephone ring, <br />
  The man who ran from   everything, <br />

  To find a place where birds could sing<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  The man who   ran from everything, <br />
  The kitchen sink, the wedding ring, <br />
  The man who ran   from everything, <br />
  To find a place where birds could sing. <br />

  <br />
  Bridge: <br />
  Funny how material possessions change a man, <br />
  Look at what's around you,   try to own it if you can. <br />
  <br />
  He made a plan to get away, <br />
  He set the   date, he named the day, <br />

  He left them all asleep in bed, <br />
  They're better   off alone he said, <br />
  <br />
  The man who ran from everything, <br />
  The working   week, the telephone ring, <br />
  The man who ran from everything, <br />

  To find a   place where birds could sing<br />
  <br />
  The man who ran from everything, <br />
  The   kitchen sink, the wedding ring, <br />
  The man who ran from everything, <br />

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>
<h3>(words &amp; music Mark Brenner)</h3></div><br /><br />
<p>On the face of it, we&rsquo;re the perfect couple,<br />
  A couple of freaks with the same ideas,<br />

  Identical dreams,<br />
  But scratch away at the surface,<br />
  Peel away the years,<br />
  And the game of happy families isn&rsquo;t what it seems.<br />
  <br />
  Oh, if we could zoom in closer,<br />

  We&rsquo;d only wonder &lsquo;what do we have here&rsquo;,<br />
  Doesn&rsquo;t take a genius or X-ray vision<br />
  To see a myriad of cracks appear.<br />
  <br />
  Chorus<br />

  <br />
  Do you know me, and do I know you,<br />
  Do we walk away from everything that we&rsquo;ve been through?<br />
  Do we turn the page, do we close the book,<br />
  Do you think that we could stand up<br />
  To a closer look?<br />

  <br />
  Let&rsquo;s be open, yeah let&rsquo;s be brutal,<br />
  A little more open than we&rsquo;ve been before,<br />
  Would it be an end, or a new beginning<br />
  If I spun on my heels and walked back out the door?<br />

  <br />
  Chorus<br />
  <br />
  Bridge<br />
  <br />
  Should I feel guilty, do I need forgiveness?<br />
  And who exactly should I confess to?<br />

  I&rsquo;ll find excuses out on every corner,<br />
  In the end it all comes down to you.<br />
  <br />
  We drift along, in the wrong direction,<br />
  Someday we&rsquo;ll end up where we&rsquo;re s&rsquo;posed to be,<br />

  It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m in search of any other,<br />
  I guess I&rsquo;m just in search of being free.<br />

  Sends my senses back to the past.</p>

  You can hit me with the hardest of things,<br />
  All   those words just go right through me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need your anger...</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time and a place to get<br />
  Out of the race<br />

  And the time and the   place is now,<br />
  Everybody&rsquo;s gonna get on your case<br />
  So you&rsquo;ve gotta get away   somehow.</p>
<p>I never thought you could be so damn hard to please,<br />
  No satisfaction &lsquo;til   I got down on my knees<br />

  But little by little I&rsquo;ve tried to ignore   you,<br />
  While you&rsquo;ve been thinking how I adore you,<br />
  You can hit me with the   largest of lies,<br />
  I&rsquo;ve made up my mind <br />
  I&rsquo;m gonna get out before you.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need your anger...<br />
